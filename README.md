# homecooked

## Project Description

Homecooked is a recipe web app where users can upload their own recipes using ingredients entered by them or existing in the database (users also have the option of adding their own ingredients). All recipes include nutrition facts (optional) and serving sizes/servings per recipe. Users can find, save, and rate other users' recipes. Each user will also have a profile where they can tell users more about them

## How I'm Building

I'm using React on the frontend with Node.js and Express on the backend and TypeScript throughout. Data will be stored using PostgreSQL. The app is deployed via Render.

I'm building the frontend first with mocked data using my own Figma design.

## This is a work in progress

Please keep in mind that this is currently a work in progress! I will be updating this project consistently, so feel free to keep up!

I'm also #buildinginpublic and participating in #100daysofcode via X (formerly Twitter).

While it's a pretty straightforward app, I'd love to also add a meal planner with a calorie and macros counter component once the main functionality of the app is completed.
